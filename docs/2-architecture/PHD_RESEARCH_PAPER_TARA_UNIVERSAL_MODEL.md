    def __init__(self):
        self.domains = []
        self.router_config = {
            "content_weight": 0.4,

        }
        self.emotional_intelligence = EmotionalIntelligenceEngine()
        self.compression = CompressionUtilities()
        self.phase_manager = PhaseManager()
    
    def add_domain(self, domain, emotional_intelligence=True):
        """Add domain with optional emotional intelligence"""
        self.domains.append({
            "name": domain,
            "emotional_intelligence": emotional_intelligence
        })

        self.primary_emotions = [
            "joy", "sadness", "anger", "fear", 
            "surprise", "disgust", "trust", "anticipation"
        ]
        self.domain_emotional_profiles = self._load_domain_profiles()
    
    def analyze_emotion(self, text):
        """Detect primary emotions and intensity in text"""
        # Implementation details omitted for brevity
        return emotions, intensity
    
    def modulate_response(self, response, detected_emotion, domain):
        """Adjust response based on emotional context and domain"""
        domain_profile = self.domain_emotional_profiles.get(domain)
        # Implementation details omitted for brevity
        return modulated_response
```

#### 3.4.4 Advanced Compression Techniques
The compression utilities implement multiple quantization methods:
