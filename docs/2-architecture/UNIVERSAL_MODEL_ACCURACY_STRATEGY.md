standard_config = {
    "batch_size": 2,
    "seq_length": 128,
    "lora_r": 8,
    "max_steps": 400,
    "memory_required": "~6-8GB"
}

# Ultra-optimized settings (< 2GB RAM available)
ultra_optimized_config = {
    "batch_size": 1,
    "seq_length": 32,
    "lora_r": 2,
    "max_steps": 200,

## 🚀 **UNIVERSAL GGUF FACTORY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Intelligent Routing System**
The Universal GGUF Factory implements advanced AI-powered routing with comprehensive analysis:

```python
class UniversalGGUFFactory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.domains = []
        self.router_config = {
            "content_weight": 0.4,
            "emotional_weight": 0.3,
            "speed_weight": 0.2,
            "quality_weight": 0.1
        }
        self.emotional_intelligence = EmotionalIntelligenceEngine()
        self.compression = CompressionUtilities()
        self.phase_manager = PhaseManager()
    
    def route_query(self, query, user_context):
        """Route query to optimal domain model"""
        
        # 1. Content Analysis (40% weight)
        content_score = self.analyze_content_relevance(query)
        
        # 2. Emotional Context (30% weight)
        emotional_score = self.analyze_emotional_context(query, user_context)
        
        # 3. Response Speed (20% weight)
        speed_score = self.assess_speed_requirements(query)
        
        # 4. Training Quality (10% weight)
        quality_score = self.get_domain_quality_scores()
        
        # Calculate optimal routing
        routing_decision = self.calculate_optimal_route(
            content_score, emotional_score, speed_score, quality_score

| User Satisfaction | 99.99% | User feedback and satisfaction ratings |

### **Validation Code Implementation**

```python
class ProductionValidator:
    """Validates model production readiness and accuracy."""
    
    async def validate_model_production_ready(self, domain, model_path):
        """Comprehensive validation of model accuracy and production readiness."""
        results = {
            "domain": domain,
            "model_path": model_path,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "tests": {}
        }
        
        # Run accuracy tests
        results["tests"]["factual_accuracy"] = await self._test_factual_accuracy(domain, model_path)
        results["tests"]["response_quality"] = await self._test_response_quality(domain, model_path)
        results["tests"]["edge_cases"] = await self._test_edge_cases(domain, model_path)
        results["tests"]["ethical_compliance"] = await self._test_ethical_compliance(domain, model_path)
        
        # Calculate overall score
        overall_score = self._calculate_overall_score(results["tests"])
        results["overall_score"] = overall_score
        results["production_ready"] = overall_score >= 0.9999  # 99.99% threshold
        
        return results
