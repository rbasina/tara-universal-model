## 📈 Training Progress Timeline

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Configuration Issues** *(June 15, 2025)*

#### ❌ **Challenge Identified**:
- **9 failed training attempts** across all domains
- **Root Cause**: `evaluation_strategy` parameter compatibility issue
- **Error**: `TrainingArguments.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'evaluation_strategy'`

#### ✅ **Solution Applied**:
- Updated `tara_universal_model/training/trainer.py` line 284
- Changed: `evaluation_strategy="no"` → `eval_strategy="no"`
- **Fix Status**: ✅ Resolved

### **Phase 2: HAI Philosophy Documentation** *(June 16, 2025)*

#### 📝 **HAI Manifesto Enhanced**:
- Added universal mission: "Help anytime, everywhere"
- Expanded real-world examples with crisis support
- Enhanced commitment to universal accessibility
- Created comprehensive vision for humanity's universal companion

### **Phase 3: Active Training Implementation** *(June 16, 2025 - Current)*

- Keyboard interrupt handling
- Background process preservation

---

## 📊 Expected Training Timeline

### **Estimated Completion**:
- **Per Domain**: 2-4 hours (CPU-only training)
- **Total Time**: 10-20 hours for all 5 domains
- **Current ETA**: ~6-8 hours remaining (based on process activity)

### **Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Adapter files created in `models/adapters/{domain}/`
- ✅ Training summary with 0 failed domains
- ✅ Model files: `pytorch_model.bin`, `config.json`
- ✅ Adapter config: `adapter_config.json`
