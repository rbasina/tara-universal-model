# Active Context - TARA Universal Model

**Last Updated**: June 26, 2025 22:45:00
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 Arc Reactor Foundation Training - REMAINING DOMAINS

## Current Work Focus

### Training Status (REMAINING DOMAINS ONLY)
- **Education Domain**: ðŸ”„ HAS CHECKPOINT-134 (33.5% progress) but status shows "loading_model"
- **Creative Domain**: ðŸ”„ STATUS "ready_to_restart" - needs to start training
- **Leadership Domain**: ðŸ”„ STATUS "ready_to_restart" - needs to start training
- **Healthcare Domain**: âœ… COMPLETED (excluded from current work)
- **Business Domain**: âœ… COMPLETED (excluded from current work)

### Current Focus: 3 Remaining Domains
**Target**: Complete education, creative, and leadership domains
**Progress**: 2/5 domains completed (40% Phase 1 complete)
**Remaining**: 3 domains need completion

### Training Commands for Remaining Domains
```bash
# Education (resume from checkpoint)
python scripts/training/parameterized_train_domains.py --domains education

# Creative and Leadership (fresh start)
python scripts/training/parameterized_train_domains.py --domains creative,leadership --force_fresh
```

## Recent Changes

### Training State Analysis (June 26, 2025)
1. **Education**: Has checkpoint-134 but state shows "loading_model" (INCONSISTENT)
2. **Creative**: Status "ready_to_restart" - checkpoint lost, needs fresh start
3. **Leadership**: Status "ready_to_restart" - checkpoint lost, needs fresh start

### Checkpoint Status (Remaining Domains)
- **Education**: Has checkpoint-134 with 33.5% progress but state inconsistent
- **Creative**: Lost all checkpoints during interruption
- **Leadership**: Lost all checkpoints during interruption

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Remaining Domains)
1. **Fix Education State**: Resolve inconsistency and resume from checkpoint-134
2. **Start Creative Training**: Begin fresh training for creative domain
3. **Start Leadership Training**: Begin fresh training for leadership domain
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track all 3 remaining domains

### Prevention Measures
1. **Use Existing Scripts**: Never create new training scripts unless absolutely necessary
2. **Verify Training Status**: Always check state files and processes after commands
3. **Checkpoint Validation**: Add integrity checks to existing parameterized_train_domains.py
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement signal handlers in existing training infrastructure

## Active Decisions

### Script Management Policy
- **PRIMARY**: Use `scripts/training/parameterized_train_domains.py` for all domain training
- **ENHANCEMENT**: Add safety features to existing scripts, don't create new ones
- **STANDARD**: Follow user requirement: "Avoid unnecessary scripts/files"

### Training Recovery Strategy
- **Resume Capable**: Use existing checkpoints when available (education)
- **Fresh Start**: Accept checkpoint loss and restart when necessary (creative, leadership)
- **Documentation**: Track all interruptions and recovery actions

## Current Challenges

### State File Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Education domain has checkpoint-134 but state shows "loading_model"
- **Solution**: Fix state file to reflect actual checkpoint status
- **Status**: Needs immediate correction

### Checkpoint Loss Prevention
- **Issue**: PowerShell interruptions cause checkpoint corruption
- **Solution**: Enhanced checkpoint validation in existing scripts
- **Status**: Implementing additional safety mechanisms

### Progress Tracking
- **Issue**: State files don't always reflect actual checkpoint status
- **Solution**: Improved state validation and backup mechanisms
- **Status**: Enhanced state management in progress

## Technical Context

### Working Scripts
- `scripts/training/parameterized_train_domains.py` - PRIMARY training script
- `scripts/training/enhanced_trainer.py` - Enhanced trainer with safety features
- `tara.bat` - Main command interface

### Training Infrastructure
- **Base Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
- **Training Method**: LoRA fine-tuning with CPU optimization
- **Checkpoint Strategy**: Multiple directory backup system
- **Recovery Method**: Existing script with enhanced error handling

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Completion Goals (Remaining Domains)
- **Education**: Fix state inconsistency and resume from checkpoint-134
- **Creative**: Complete fresh training with enhanced checkpointing
- **Leadership**: Complete fresh training with enhanced checkpointing
- **Overall**: Achieve 5/5 domains completed for Phase 1 (currently 2/5)

### Quality Assurance
- **Checkpoint Integrity**: Validate all saved checkpoints
- **State Consistency**: Ensure state files match actual checkpoint status
- **Training Continuity**: Ensure no more progress loss
- **Documentation**: Track all recovery actions and lessons learned
