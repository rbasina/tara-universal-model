model_path = "models/meetara-universal-embedded-Q4_K_M.gguf"

# Initialize intelligent routing
router = IntelligentUniversalRouter()
intelligence = SeamlessIntelligenceEngine()

# Enhanced processing with TARA intelligence
analysis = await intelligence.analyze_message(user_message)
response = await router.process_message(user_message, user_id)
```
