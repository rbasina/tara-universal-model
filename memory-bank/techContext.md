## Training System Optimizations

### CPU-Optimized Training Configuration (June 27, 2025)
We've implemented CPU-optimized training configurations to improve performance on systems without dedicated GPUs:

```yaml
# CPU-Optimized Training Configuration
training:
  # Reduced parameters for CPU efficiency
  batch_size: 1                # Reduced from 2
  max_sequence_length: 64      # Reduced from 128
  lora_r: 4                    # Reduced from 8
  lora_alpha: 8                # Reduced from 16
  save_steps: 20               # More frequent checkpoints
  max_steps: 200               # Set limit for faster completion
  
  # CPU stability settings
  fp16: false                  # Disabled for CPU training
  use_gradient_checkpointing: false
  dataloader_num_workers: 0    # Reduced for memory stability
```

These optimizations significantly improve training speed and stability on CPU-only systems.

### Training Monitoring Tools
We've developed several tools to monitor and manage the training process:

1. **monitor_creative_training.py**: Real-time monitoring of training progress with state file updates
2. **parameterized_train_domains.py**: Enhanced training script with robust checkpoint handling and state tracking
3. **tara.bat**: Unified command interface for training and monitoring

### Checkpoint Management System
Our checkpoint system now follows a dual-directory structure:

1. **Primary Location**: `models/{domain}/meetara_trinity_phase_efficient_core_processing/checkpoint-{step}`
2. **Secondary Location**: `models/adapters/{domain}_{model_short_name}/checkpoint-{step}`

This provides better organization, cross-compatibility, and easier recovery from training interruptions.

### State Tracking System
Each domain has its own state file in `training_state/{domain}_training_state.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "domain": "domain_name",
  "base_model": "model_name",
  "output_dir": "output_directory",
  "resume_checkpoint": "checkpoint_path",
  "start_time": "timestamp",
  "status": "training",
  "retries": 0,
  "current_step": 150,
  "total_steps": 400,
  "progress_percentage": 37,
  "last_update": "timestamp",
  "notes": "Training in progress"
}
```

State files are updated every 60 seconds during training to provide real-time progress tracking.
