### **🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES**
- Fixed parameter incompatibility issue (`evaluation_strategy` vs `eval_strategy`)
- Disabled `load_best_model_at_end` to avoid conflicts with save_steps and eval_steps
- Fixed training monitoring dashboard to track all domains in parallel

### **🔄 TRAINING RECOVERY SYSTEM**
- ✅ Implemented robust training recovery system for handling interruptions
- ✅ Created `scripts/monitoring/training_recovery.py` for auto-resumption
- ✅ Created `monitor_and_resume_training.ps1` for system-level monitoring
- ✅ Added recovery button to domain optimization dashboard
- ✅ Created scheduled task system for auto-resume after system restart
